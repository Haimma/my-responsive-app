React App - RTL/LTR Responsive Screens 🌍📱💻
📌 Overview
This is a fully responsive React application built using Vite, with support for RTL (Right-to-Left) and LTR (Left-to-Right) layouts. The app dynamically adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

It includes several example screens with mock data (no backend integration or data persistence) to demonstrate various UI components, including:
✅ Sidebar & Header Navigation (Responsive & Toggleable)

✅ Dynamic Theme Switching (RTL/LTR Mode)
